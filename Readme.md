# Aho-Corasick algorithm in Haskell

`AC.hs`, used as `ac :: [String] -> String -> [String]` standing for `ac :: [Searched Words] -> Text to search -> [Occurences]`. Occurences are listed in order of finding them. This implementation is pure Haskell, no libraries added or needed.

Made for a _Haskell&Prolog_ course of nonprocedural programming for Charles University, Prague.

### KMP

I also implemented a Knutt-Morris-Pratt algorithm in Haskell, so it is added in `KMP.hs`.
